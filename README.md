# NLP-and-Sentiment-analysis-using-Finance-Complaints

This project represents a pioneering endeavor in the financial services sector, harnessing the transformative power of natural language processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis to decode and interpret customer experiences across various financial service categories. Our approach was to meticulously analyze customer feedback and interactions within segments like banking services, consumer loans, credit cards, and more, using advanced NLP techniques.

By applying these sophisticated analytical tools, we aimed to uncover deeper insights into customer experiences that traditional data analysis methods might overlook. This project not only illuminates the current state of customer satisfaction in the financial sector but also highlights areas for improvement, helping financial institutions to better align their services with customer needs and expectations.
